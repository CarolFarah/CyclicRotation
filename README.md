# CyclicRotation
developed on Codility


##Task description
An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each
element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the
􀀦rst place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements
are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the 􀀦rst place).
The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the
right K times.
